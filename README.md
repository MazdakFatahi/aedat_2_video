# aedat_2_video
Read from aedat file and write as video ( or images) using openCV

## NOTE:
To read the `aedat` files, I used the code from:
https://github.com/SensorsINI/processAEDAT/blob/master/jAER_utils/loadaerdat.py

The sample `aedat` file belongs to the recordings for the APROVIS3D project: http://aprovis3d.eu/
